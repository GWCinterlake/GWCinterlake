      During this field trip, Girls Who Code members had a lot of fun and learned a lot about different positions in tech companies. It was a great experience!

      We visited a Google office as a club and had a great time! We toured the whole campus and got to try all the great snacks in the cafeterias! We also were able to ask different people who worked there about what their jobs involved and their career paths, how they ended up working for Google and the other work experiences they had. It was amazing and everyone agreed that if given the chance, they would love to visit the Google offices again!
